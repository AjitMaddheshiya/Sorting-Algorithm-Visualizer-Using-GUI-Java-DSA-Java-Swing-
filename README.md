ðŸ”¢ Sorting Algorithm Visualizer Using GUI
Technologies Used: Java | Java Swing | DSA (Sorting Algorithms)

ðŸ“Œ Project Summary
An educational Java-based application that visually demonstrates how various sorting algorithms work through real-time animations and user interaction.

ðŸ§  Key Features
Multiple Sorting Algorithms:
Visualizes classic sorting techniques including:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Heap Sort

Interactive GUI (Java Swing):
Built an intuitive interface to animate sorting processes and provide users with dynamic learning visuals.

Algorithmic Optimization:
Implemented efficient sorting logic using core data structures and algorithmic principles to compare performance and complexity.

User Controls:

Select desired sorting algorithm

Adjust array size and animation speed

Reset and re-run visualizations

Observe execution flow in real-time
